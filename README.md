# Module-3 of Scalable Data Science and Distributed Machine Learning

## Module 3 â€“ Decision-making with Scalable Algorithms:

Theoretical foundations of distributed systems and analysis of their scalable algorithms for sorting, joining, streaming, sketching, optimizing and computing in numerical linear algebra with applications in scalable machine learning pipelines for typical decision problems (e.g., prediction, A/B testing, anomaly detection) with various types of data (eg. time-indexed, space-time-indexed, and network-indexed). Privacy-aware decisions with sanitized (cleaned, imputed, anonymized) datasets and datastreams. Practical applications of these algorithms on real-world examples (e.g., mobility, social media, machine sensors, and logs). Illustration via industrial use-cases.
